# Minecraft Ore Randomizer

This is a project inspired by Jay Exci's video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CS5DQVSp058) on how infinite features could be added to Minecraft. The end goal for this project is to have a mod which allows you to have fully working and unique random ores naturally found in the world.

## Notes

- For extra control over the program, you can run it through a terminal. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the program. Next, activate the virtual environment (on Windows `venv\Scripts\activate`, on Unix: `source venv/bin/activate`), then type `python generator.py <options>` on Windows and `python3 generator.py <options>` on Unix. Use the `-h` option for more information.
